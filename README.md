# SYTApp
This app is all about saving your time . We have created an application to know the live status  of traffic @ foodcourt of SAP Bangalore location. The main aim is to let people make informed decision at a particular time in choosing a foodcourt. This will save your time as you will know in advance which food court has the availability for you and your friends.  The app will have the option to let you know which food is available in which food court if suppose you are interested in one main course special dish. The App gives you the option of booking a table if there is a Team Lunch.  We are providing a weekly graphical analysis which will predict the best time to eat at a particular foodcourt based on historic data. Considering the impact of food wastage, we are also extending the app for saving food. We have integrated a live feedback status of food items so that you may choose not to take a particular food item if for example the feedback says ” it is spicy”  hence saving food wastage.  For the demo purpose we will concentrate on the Food Courts but in future implementation of this application we are planning to extend it to other common places of SAP location like Gym, Ordering Food from private outlets at SAP location.  This app provides a solution to a very basic problem of availability in a gamified approach to provide an all in all  complete time saving application
